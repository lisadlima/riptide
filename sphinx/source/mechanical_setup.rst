Guidelines
----------

Fasteners
~~~~~~~~~
Use antiseize if aluminum is used in the mate.
Look up max tightening torque for bolt size and materials mating.

LOCTITE 222 THREADLOCKER is applied to all bolts/screws threading into stainless steel or connecting the sealing latches to the main aluminum housing. MARINE GRADE ANTI-SEIZE is applied to all other bolts/screws threading into aluminum prior to fastening. 8-32 bolts used to compress gasket should be tightened to a torque of 9 inch-pounds. All other bolts/screws should be hand-tightened.

.. warning::
   The heads of all bolts/screws must be free of wear and show no indication of stripping (Discarded damaged fasteners immediately). If you need to unbolt a fastener with Locktite, heat bolt up first with heat gun (be careful of fumes)

Gaskets
~~~~~~~

The rubber is free of cuts and scratches that cross the entire surface. All holes for bolts hold the fastener snuggly. When compressed, the gasket is extruded evenly around all sides.

O-Rings
~~~~~~~

The rubber is free of all nicks, cuts, excessive wear, discoloration, and/or permanent deformation. The o-ring groove is free of water and solid particles. The o-ring has been greased with MOLYKOTE 55 o-ring grease prior to every fitting.

Star Pattern
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bolt/unbolt in a star pattern to evenly compress/decompress gasket or o-rings and evenly pretension bolts. Star pattern means a criss cross pattern for circular bolt patterns or spiral pattern for non-circular bolt patterns, for each bolt. Perform star pattern twice.

Anti-Seize
~~~~~~~~~~

Roll the last quarter inch of the bolt in anti-seize making sure to thoroughly coat all threads. Wipe the excess off such that the remaining anti-seize completely fills the space between threads. (Roll threads of coated bolt around threads of uncoated bolt to transfer excess anti-seize and ensure threads are fully coated.)

Chassis
-------

.. image:: /_static/chassis.png


Fasteners
~~~~~~~~~

Use only SS 18-8 #8-32 3/4" bolts to tighten components together with antiseize.

Assembly
~~~~~~~~

Cross braces from main housing have Loctite 271 high strength on bolts.
If you need to unbolt these, heat it up first (be careful of fumes)

Interior Electronics

.. image:: /_static/interior_electronics.png

#. Secure the pressure sensor wire out to the upper surface of the housing to prevent it from snagging on the interior electronics.
#. Insert interior electronics from the forward side.

I/O Panel x2
#. Place I/O Panel gaskets into the Central Section, both port and starboard.
#. Place the Port I/O panel against the I/O panel gasket with the giant power SubConn on the forward side. (See panel chart.)

#. Hand-tighten bolts in star pattern, then torque to spec. (Add links.)

.. warning::
   Using a flashlight inspect the interior mating face to ensure the gasket is properly seated, repeat with finger.

.. warning::
   Ensure the I/O panel bolts pass through the interior electronics without being forced, or the electronics mounting could bend and warp.

**Backplane:**

#. Hand-tighten backplane to electronics mounting rods with four 4-40, 3/8", SS bolts
#. Bolt the backplane to the electronics rocket's four cantilevered rods using backplane screws and washers.
#. Connect all the cables. (See wiring diagram)

**Forward Section:**

Preparing the 2 X-profile Bruna-N 265 O-Rings:

#. Clean out the o-ring grooves on central section with cotton swabs.
#. With clean hands squeeze a pea sized amount of o-ring grease onto your thumb and forefinger.
#. Pull the o-ring through the grease while applying steady pressure to ensure the o-ring is evenly coated. (Perform 3 revolutions of the o-ring to ensure an even coating.)
#. Starting with the o-ring in contact with the aftermost groove, stretch the o-ring around the circumference of the tube and release it into the groove.
#. Repeat for the second o-ring.

.. warning::
   Check the o-ring to make sure it is not twisted.

Attaching the forward end-cap:

#. Clean the mating surfaces and gasket, ensuring to remove any excess anti-seize.

#. Line up the sealing surfaces
#. Tighten all bolts using the star pattern procedure.

Attaching the Forward Section to Central Section:

#. Align the sections so that the latch tabs are horizontal.
#. Place the leading edge of the housing onto the after frame curved crossbar.
#. Slide the housing forward until, it is within an inch of the central portion.
#. Slide the mating surfaces together, pushing firmly to engage the first o-ring.
#. Hook the latches over the latch tabs, and pull latches at the same time until closed.
#. The housing is sealed if and only if both mating surfaces are now in full contact with one-another. (The upper portion will be more "in full contact" than the lower portion.)


**Aft Section:**

Prepare 2 o-rings. See the Forward Section, "Preparing the 2 X-profile Bruna-N 265 O-Rings" procedure.

Attaching the aft end-cap:

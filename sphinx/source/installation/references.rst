Guidelines
----------

Fasteners
~~~~~~~~~
Use antiseize if aluminum is used in the mate.
Look up max tightening torque for bolt size and materials mating.

LOCTITE 222 THREADLOCKER is applied to all bolts/screws threading into stainless steel or connecting the sealing latches to the main aluminum housing. MARINE GRADE ANTI-SEIZE is applied to all other bolts/screws threading into aluminum prior to fastening. 8-32 bolts used to compress gasket should be tightened to a torque of 9 inch-pounds. All other bolts/screws should be hand-tightened.

.. warning::
   The heads of all bolts/screws must be free of wear and show no indication of stripping (damaged fasteners should be discarded immediately).

Gaskets
~~~~~~~

The rubber is free of cuts and scratches that cross the entire surface. All holes for bolts hold the fastener snuggly. When compressed, the gasket is extruded evenly around all sides.

O-Rings
~~~~~~~

The rubber is free of all nicks, cuts, excessive wear, discoloration, and/or permanent deformation. The o-ring groove is free of water and solid particles. The o-ring has been greased with MOLYKOTE 55 o-ring grease prior to every fitting.

Star Pattern
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Do it twice. Then, starting at the 12 o'clock position and working clockwise, tighten each bolt.

Anti-Seize
~~~~~~~~~~

Roll the last quarter inch of the bolt in anti-seize making sure to thoroughly coat all threads. Wipe the excess off such that the remaining anti-seize completely fills the space between threads. (Roll threads of coated bolt around threads of uncoated bolt to transfer excess anti-seize and ensure threads are fully coated.)

* See `Exterior Cables & Hoses`_ for SubConn connections.

Assembly
~~~~~~~~

#. Securely tighten hydrophones to mounting block.
#. Place hydrophone gasket on [something].
#. Place hydrophone block on hydrophone gasket.
#. Secure block and gasket using three mounting block fasteners.
#. Place lid gasket on housing.
#. Place lid on gasket.
#. Secure lid and gasket using eight lid fasteners in a star pattern.

Mounting
~~~~~~~~

#. 2 Man Job: 1st person lifts robot straight up by front chassis handles, exposing robot under-belly
#. 2nd person holds acoustic housing and unlatch. Gently pull acoustic housing from chassis. Note: Subconn still connected!
#. Remove Subconn
#. Relatch the latch. Set robot down.


Battery Housings
----------------

.. note::

   The following applies to a single battery housing and must be repeated for the second housing.

============= ===== ====== ==== =============

* See `Exterior Cables & Hoses`_ for SubConn connections.

Assembly
~~~~~~~~

#. The relief valve has to go on to the mounting block FIRST.
#. Screw NPT thread valve onto mounting block.
#. Secure the valve assembly to the housing using 4 relief valve bolts.
#. Place the housing lid gasket on the housing.
#. Place the lid gasket onto the housing.
#. Place the lid onto the housing and gasket.
#. Secure the lid using 8 fasteners in a star pattern.

Mounting
~~~~~~~~

.. note::
   The data SubConn must be attached to the battery housing and all other main housing subconns must be attached prior to placing the battery housing into it's receptacle.

#. Align the battery housing such that the power cable is facing forward and the data cable is facing upward (relief valve down).
#. Place the battery housing into the chassis receptacle by first inserting the aft end working the forward portion in.
#. Secure the battery housing by closing the retaining arms and engaging the latch.

#. Repeat for the other side.

Pneumatics Housing
------------------

.. warning::
   If the pneumatics system will not be used and the hoses will not be inserted the grabbers and pnuematics housing must be removed from the vehicle prior to submerging.

Pneumatic Connections:

*	All ports on external pneumatics matrix occupied and secured
*	Ports on internal pneumatics matrix occupied if necessary and secured
* pneumatic arrangement:

Assembly
~~~~~~~~

.. warning::
   The housing lid and gasket appear to be a square, but are in fact rectangular. Take special care to align the lid and gasket properly or

#. Put the relief valve itself onto something.
#. Place relief valve gaskets where they go.
#. Put the relief valve block between them?
#. Secure the relief valve using four Krylon bolts.
#. Place tube matrix gasket on the housing.
#. Place tube matrix on the gasket.
#. Secure the tube matrix and gasket using 6 Nylon bolts.
#. Place the housing lid gasket on the housing.
#. Place the housing lid on the gasket.
#. Secure the housing lid and gasket using 12 screws.

Mounting
~~~~~~~~

#. 4 Latches must secure pneumatics housing to chassis
#. Bolt housing to chassis with 9/64" hex driver
#. For removal, keep 2 forward latches secured while unscrewing bolts

Removal of Air Tank
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#. Remove hose from nozzle of tank. Close valve securely!
#. Hold tank and remove 4 screws holding paintball tank to chassis using 4-40 hex key. Note: pull tank towards screws, thruster removal NOT neccessary
#. Slowly remove tank: Twist tank so delrin mounting points are upward and remove tank.


Disassembly
~~~~~~~~~~~
#. Unlatch latches on side needed.
#. Firmly Pull each tube out. Do NOT damage O-ring seals.
#. Remove Subconn plates and clear interior electronics. Note: careful of red pressure sensor cord. See interior electronics removal.
#. Unscrew 4 bolts that attach housing to chassis using 9-64 hex key.
#. Lift main housing straight up.
